<h3>don't touch face</h3>
<p>Stop touching your face to reduce your chances of catching coronavirus,
experts say.
Tactics include wearing woolly gloves and an app that sounds a warning if your
hand moves to your face.
But face-touching is an instinctive response to stress and a hard habit to break</p>

<h3>wash your hand</h3>
<p>Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and
apply soap. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of
your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. Scrub your hands for at least 20
seconds. ....Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.</p>

<h3>wear a mask</h3>
<p> Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you
take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. When you take off a mask,
store it in a clean plastic bag,
and every day either wash it if it's a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical
mask in a trash bin. Don't use masks with valves.</p>
